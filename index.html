            <h2>Project Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I really enjoyed figuring out I was better at it than I thought.
                Figuring out how to do the pictures right.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned small details like misspelling something can really affect the code.
                I fixed it by going through the code that looked like it had an error.
                This taught me that solving problems with code is like looking through an essay and finding grammar mistakes.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>
                While building it, I used tools like talking to the people around me and working with them.
                It means to be able to figure out a solution that may not have been thought of before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because AI can and has made mistakes so it’s important to learn for that also to not be called for plagiarism.
                That coding is actually pretty fun and practice and guidance can help do it.
                You would/could get program errors because I have seen teachers use AI and it messes up Quizzez sometimes.

            <p>
                Through this project, I learned the importance of being patient and ready to learn from others as well as assist them when they don’t get it.
